# CliniClarity: From Medical Anxiety to Medical Literacy

**"A personal health research assistant designed to be a bridge between a clinical visit and a patient's home life."**

## Product Vision and Strategy
CliniClarity is not a diagnostic engine; it is a specialized research librarian engineered to help patients navigate complex medical journey

### Problem: Dense Jargon and "Dr.Google
* **Medical Complexity:** Patients often receive 20+ page medical or imaging reports where critical insights are buried. 
* **Information Gap:** Reports are written for billing and peer-to-peer clinical communication, not for patient comprehension
* **Unverified Sources:** When turning to search engines, patients encounted a mix of "Dr.Google" anecdotes, unverified blogs, and marketing that lacks clinical validity
